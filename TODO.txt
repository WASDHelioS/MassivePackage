- FIX THE VECTOR SECTION IN PLAYERLISTENER - ONPLAYERINTERACT

- CATCH ERRORS IN CREATING A NEW CEDIT COMMAND (RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE CAN JUST USE /CEDIT ADD FROMC 'some command' TOC 'some other command' 
						, AS WELL AS THEY CAN USE /CEDIT ADD TOC 'some command' FROMC 'some other command'. THIS WOULD CREATE A FAULTY TOC, E.G.
							cedit:
							  tocommand: -some command fromc some other command
						          fromcommand: some other command )
		(Possibly make sure that the previous command is the right one, e.g. if(last-command.equalsIgnoreCase('fromc')) or someth.
		OR create a new method isBefore(String[] args, string before, string after))
